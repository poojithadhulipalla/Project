        Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad also known as “Mohabat Pahad” in early days on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took ten years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by the Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all known as Birla Mandir.

        Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Deva and Devi, including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati and Lakshmi. Selected teachings of men and Gurbani are engraved on temple walls. Birla temples are open to all, as identified by Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders.
