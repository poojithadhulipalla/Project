        The Statue of Equality is a statue of the 11th-century Indian philosopher Ramanuja, located on the premises of the Chinna Jeeyar Trust at Muchintal, Ranga Reddy district in the outskirts of Hyderabad.[2] It is the second tallest sitting statue in the world. The project of building the statue was conceptualised by the trust to commemorate the 1,000th birth anniversary of Ramanuja. Costing an estimated â‚¹1,000 crore (US$120 million), the project was paid for through monetary donations by devotees in a major part.
